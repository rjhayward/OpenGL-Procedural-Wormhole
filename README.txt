This is the Rainbow Donut Party App.


Use the mouse to look around different angles of the Rainbow Party Donut.

You can use the scroll wheel or Up/Down keys to scale the donut.

To control the intensity of light, use the F1-F5 keys.

To turn on Wireframe, press 2. To switch back to normal mode press 1.

To switch between DONUT PARTY MODES press W, E, R for differing levels of donut insanity.

To go back to the original donut press Q.


Thanks!

P.s. all of the work in the Donut.cs file is mine except from the sigmoid function which is from Wikipedia.
The other files may contain some fragments of the lab code but it has been modified to work with C# OpenTK.
